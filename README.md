# In ALY6000: Introduction to Analytics course, I studied the dataset from Kaggle called “The Health Insurance Premium of Customers.” The dataset contains 76,855 records and 13 usable features.
For insurance companies, when a vast number of customers do not pay their premiums on time, the system cannot function smoothly. They cannot have a stable income stream to maintain their system. That is why investigating the impact of various factors on the healthcare premium system is crucial and analyzing the efficiency of the health insurance premiums can be used to develop better strategies for reducing healthcare costs and improving the operation of healthcare delivery. 

Our goal is to find the distribution of the Health Insurance premium and target which factors can be considered to improve the premium payment efficiency.
